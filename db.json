You can conveniently dump all your bags in the back seat and yet sit comfortably throughout the journey."

      "description": "When a reliable brand like Toyota backs a car, you don't need to look for any other vehicle for your road trips. Ask yourself, have you ever seen a Toyota car broken down on the highway? Probably never. This is what a car like Toyota Etios Liva gives you: dependability. The Liva is a bit sporty in its revamped exteriors. The multi-spoke alloy wheels speak volumes about the great looks. When you are traveling in the Etios Liva, you do get a simplistic cabin, which tends to the comfort of each passenger. The strategically placed door lock buttons, external mirrors, and headlamps make it convenient to access them. The cabin of the car offers excellent storage space, and the seats are comfortable enough to support the shoulders and under thighs for a relaxed ride."

The new 520d shows how successful BMW has been in revolutionising the efficiency of its cars – without any sacrifices in the driving experience.This is in large part due to BMW rolling out its EfficientDynamics technology on all of its models. The BMW 520d, which shares a new engine with the 320d EfficientDynamics , is the first 5 Series to come with Auto Start-Stop, which reduces the engine idle period when coming to a short stop. Brake Energy Regeneration, which recharges the vehicle’s battery during engine over-run, is part of the standard specification for all 5 Series saloons."

Maneuvering a compact SUV like Renault Duster is even easier when you have to drive on the curvy mountain roads. The enormous storage in the Duster combined with clean interiors and sleek exteriors is just the thing you would want for an extended road trip. The impressive fuel mileage gives Renault Duster bonus points since you will save more money than you will spend on a chauffeur-driven car."

And those who do not have Maruti Swift can now easily rent it for road trips and have an incredible driving experience. The reason you must rent a Swift for your next vacation is that first, it is a sturdy car; and second, even if it develops a fault while on the road, you can go to any automobile service center and have your vehicle repaired. The diesel and petrol versions of Maruti Swift are fun to drive. You can dump your luggage in the moderately-sized boot of the car, and access everything while sitting in the car.

And those who do not have Maruti Swift can now easily rent it for road trips and have an incredible driving experience. The reason you must rent a Swift for your next vacation is that first, it is a sturdy car; and second, even if it develops a fault while on the road, you can go to any automobile service center and have your vehicle repaired. The diesel and petrol versions of Maruti Swift are fun to drive. You can dump your luggage in the moderately-sized boot of the car, and access everything while sitting in the car. It may remind you of those good old days of your childhood when you wanted to sit in the boot and talk to your family sitting in the cabin of the car."
